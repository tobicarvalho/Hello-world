# Hello-world
Getting start up on github

Hi, I use to do scientific programmation, things like simulation, data telecommunication with a satelite and things like this, I'm finishing my master in physics soon and I want to get back to be used to do coding a bit.

I'll try to participate in projects on the side and that's pretty much what it is.

I'm from montreal, my first langague is french (don't judge my english too hard, I barely ever write or speak it in day to day situation...)
